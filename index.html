            <p>My name is Jaycee Bagtas. It has been a couple of days since my last drink and an undetermined amount of time since I last had a good night's rest but I attribute that to the fact that I had pre-existing insomnia before I decided to become a developer. Prior to becoming a developer, I was a stunt double for Ken Jeong. Unfortunately, Ken Joeng hasn't starred in a lot of action films so I have had to find employment in a different field.</p>

            <p>Seriously speaking though, prior to becoming a developer, I spent several years in private culinary education as Director of Admissions and later, as Director of Financial Aid. I assisted countless students, many of whom were developers, pursue their culinary passions and begin careers as chefs and entreprenuers. My employer recently closed their business so instead of going back into private postsecondary education, I decided to follow the advice that I've given my students - pursue something that they are passionate about. For me, that's finding solutions to various problems. What a better way to do that than to become a developer?</p>

            <p>I look forward to sharing my passion for solving things with you! Take a look around my portfolio and contacct me for details on how we can get started with your project today!</p>
