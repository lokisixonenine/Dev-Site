## Post Full Stack Boot Camp Update
This site was the second website that I did as part of my Full Stack Boot Camp over at UCSD Extension through Trilogy Education Services. It was one of the first coding assignments that we were tasked with and as cringy as it looks now, I'm still pretty proud of it. Here is an image of the site as deployed on GitHub Pages:
