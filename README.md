# Dev-Site
Portfolio of past, current, and future work

Welcome to my portfolio. On this site, I showcase my development as a developer. This site also serves as a tool to help me measure my growth by allowing me to compare my past work with my current projects. 

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
